# Advent of Code 2022

I am interested in learning Rust, so I decide to challenge myself on solving the
[advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) using rust only

The algorithm choosen will not be optimal, the purpose of this challenge to me is to get familiar
with the syntax and std library of Rust.
